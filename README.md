SQL pre-work is a fast way to ramp up for the SQL Data Analytics Seminar.

Please refer to the required book, SQL Queries for Mere Mortals,  in order to get a solid understanding of relational databases and SQL queries.
Part 1: Relational Databases and SQL
- Review the slides here: https://github.com/MelMcGee/sql-pre-work/blob/master/SQL%20in%207.%20Day%201.%20Relational%20DBs%20and%20SQL%20Overview.%20%20(1).pdf

Part 2: SQL Basics

The databases used in this book can be downloaded at www.informit.com/title/9780321992475 (at the bottom, look for the "downloads" tab and click to get the code files). You may also get these files from this repository. They are zipped and located in SQLQFMM3.zip.

Please grab the databases there and insert them into your SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio) or MySQL instance (C# devs should go for SSMS / MS SQL. Others should use MySQL).

If you need to download SSMS or SQL Server, please see https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh213248.aspx and follow the instructions from there.

If you need to download MySQL, see http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/. Install MySQL and MySQL workbench.

I haven't fully tested this, but if you'd like to try online sql, check out http://sqlfiddle.com/.

When you have finished downloading SSMS and SQL Server or MySQL and MySQL Workbench, follow along with the video found here: https://youtu.be/p4CDlwLoN6s
